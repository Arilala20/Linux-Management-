# Linux Management


# Account Setting 

To start, I registered for a Microsoft Azure account using our university email. After successfully setting up the account, I received $100 in credits, which I can use to acquire different tools for building a productive learning environment.


# Create Virtual Machine

I created a virtual machine to learn and work on projects for this course. I named the machine "lab-robotics" and selected the "No infrastructure redundancy required" option, along with the "Trusted launch" security type for the virtual machine. For the operating system, I chose Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS - x64 Gen2, and for the virtual machine size, I selected the B series version 2, specifically Standard_B21s_v2.

Once all the setup steps were completed, I received a key and chose the "Connect" option, selecting the native SSH method. There was a button to copy and execute the SSH command, so I pasted the key I had received earlier. Then, I opened Windows PowerShell, pasted the generated link, and was able to access the Linux virtual machine. This process allows me to use Linux on my Windows laptop without needing to install it.

# Linking My GitHub Account to my HAMK Email

I created a new repository named "Linux Management" for the assignment.
Then I linked my HAMK email as a secondary mail for version control.
